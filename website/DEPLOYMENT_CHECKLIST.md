# StaticWebsiteToS3 Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for safely deploying the StaticWebsiteToS3 application to AWS S3.

## Pre-Deployment Checks

### Code Quality
- [ ] All linting issues resolved
- [ ] TypeScript compilation successful
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Component tests passing

### Build Verification
- [ ] Production build completes without errors
- [ ] Bundle size is within acceptable limits (check with `du -sh dist/`)
- [ ] No console errors when running locally

### AWS Configuration
- [ ] S3 bucket exists and is accessible
- [ ] IAM permissions are correctly configured
- [ ] AWS credentials are valid and have appropriate permissions

### Security
- [ ] No high or critical vulnerabilities in dependencies
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in the code
- [ ] All API endpoints are properly secured

## Deployment Process

### 1. Pre-Deployment Backup
- [ ] Create backup of current S3 content
  ```bash
  aws s3 sync s3://demo-static-website-hosting-1106/ backup/
  ```

### 2. Deployment
- [ ] Run the automated safety checks
  ```bash
  ./scripts/release_safety_check.sh
  ```
- [ ] Deploy to S3
  ```bash
  aws s3 sync dist/ s3://demo-static-website-hosting-1106/ --delete
  ```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification
- [ ] Website loads correctly
- [ ] All major functionality works as expected
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

## Rollback Procedure

If issues are detected after deployment:

1. Restore from backup
   ```bash
   aws s3 sync backup/ s3://demo-static-website-hosting-1106/ --delete
   ```
2. Verify rollback success
3. Document the issue and rollback in an incident report

## Automated Verification

Run the automated verification script to perform most of these checks:

```bash
./scripts/release_safety_check.sh
```

## GitHub Actions Integration

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. Run safety checks
2. Create a backup
3. Deploy to S3
4. Verify the deployment
5. Roll back if verification fails

To manually trigger the workflow, push to the main branch or create a pull request.
